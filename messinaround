/*
    Problem/output:
        Solar Eclipse Bank has a problem. They want to have an automated
        way to display the customer birthdays, for each month, for the
        next 10 years. They would like to see the customer's name, and their
        current age, displayed in the correct month. Here's an example they
        provided of how they would like the data displayed.

        2022
        "February"
        ---------------
        Miles Goodworth is n years old
        Barbara Forsythe is n years old

        2022
        "March"
        ---------------


        2022
        "April"
        ---------------
        Lisa Jackson is n years old
        Michael Weathersby is n years old
